# Optimization Functions Visualizer

A toolkit for visualizing and analyzing optimization problems, including 2D function visualization and constrained optimization.

## üöÄ Features

*   **Function Visualization**: 2D contour plots and 3D surface visualizations.
*   **Constrained Optimization**: Solves optimization problems with inequality constraints.
*   **Sensitivity Analysis**: Analyzes how solutions change with parameter variations.
*   **Six-Hump Camel Function**: An implementation of the classic optimization test function.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

To use the toolkit, you can import the `OptimizationVisualizer` and `ConstrainedOptimizer` classes and use their methods to plot functions, solve optimization problems, and perform sensitivity analysis.
