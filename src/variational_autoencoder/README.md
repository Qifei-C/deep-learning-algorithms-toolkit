# Variational Autoencoder

This project implements a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for generating and reconstructing images, primarily using the MNIST dataset.

## 🚀 Core Components

*   **VAE Model**: An implementation of a Variational Autoencoder, including an encoder, a decoder, and the reparameterization trick.
*   **MNIST Data Handling**: Scripts for downloading, preprocessing, and loading the MNIST dataset.
*   **Training and Visualization**: Includes a trainer for the VAE model and a visualizer to plot training curves, show reconstructed images, and display generated samples.

## 🛠️ Usage

To run the project, you can execute the main script, which will train the VAE on the MNIST dataset and visualize the results.
