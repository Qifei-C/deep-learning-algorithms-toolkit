# RNN Text Generation

This project implements a character-level Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using LSTM for text generation.

## 🚀 Core Components

*   **Character-Level LSTM**: An LSTM-based model for character-level language modeling.
*   **Text Processing**: Scripts for downloading, preprocessing, and creating datasets from classic texts.
*   **Text Generation**: A generator that uses the trained model to create new text with temperature-controlled sampling.
*   **Training and Evaluation**: A trainer to train the RNN model and track metrics like perplexity.

## 🛠️ Usage

To run the project, you can execute the main script, which will download text data, train the RNN model, and generate new text.
