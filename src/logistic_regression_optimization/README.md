# Logistic Regression Optimization

This project explores various optimization algorithms for logistic regression, including Gradient Descent, Nesterov Momentum, and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).

## üöÄ Core Components

*   **Optimizers**: Implementations of different optimization algorithms.
*   **Logistic Regression Model**: A logistic regression model with L2 regularization.
*   **MNIST Data Handling**: Scripts for downloading, preprocessing, and loading the MNIST dataset for binary classification.
*   **Training and Analysis**: A trainer to run the optimization algorithms and analyze their convergence and performance.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

To run the project, you can execute the main script, which will train the logistic regression model using different optimizers and visualize the results.
